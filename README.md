# IndoorNavigator
Displays the signal strength of WIFI access points in relation to the distance between the user and the access point using various algorithms. Also highlights a path from either the current room or a user-selected room to another room.  The second room is user-selected. There is also an option to randomly choose a room to create a path to. The path selection uses the Breadth First Search algorithm to find the shortest path. This program uses a priority queue to find and display access points with the highest signal strength based on the current room.
